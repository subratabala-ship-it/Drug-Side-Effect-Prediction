Everything has worsened over the last year since my youngest, fittest sister died prematurely of breast cancer with extensive liver metastasis (or whichever came first)…I was with her for the 7 weeks after diagnosis and watched her take her last 2 breaths; this pain has become more intense lately and I would find myself crying like a baby over my little sister…
My demented elderly father got a prescription for Zoloft (he must also be depressed because of my sister’s death), but since no one at his home was giving it to him I decided to give it a try!
I’ve been taking 25mg (elixir) for 2 weeks and have seen a huge difference in my crying spells; I still think about my little sister, but don’t feel that overwhelming sadness as much…
The first week I took the Zoloft at bedtime, but started to notice difficulty falling asleep, so now I take it in the morning…I felt no other side effects!
I’m far from being a peppy, energetic person, but at least some of my suffering has been alleviated, and that’s what living is about; who needs to be in constant emotional pain!?

Some cons: I was a little nauseous whenever my dosage was upped and had sleep issues for a while, but they went away. In fact I actually have an irrational fear of vomiting and was very nervous about starting because of this, but the it was negligible at worst and, if I haven't said enough already, worth the brief amount of time I experienced it.

I have never had a regular period since I was 13 .Probably only got my period twice a year since I was 13 and when it eventually came it was really bad.

Got married in 2010 and started trying for a baby. Got pregnant in Jan of 2011 even without having regular periods but unfortunately I miscarried.

Was only diagnosed in late 2012 with PCOS and  went onto Glucophage in august 2011.
With the help my wonderful doc I conceived in November of the same year and delivered a health baby boy in August of 2012.

I used to feel depressed all the time, no motivation to reach any goals, leaving house was impossible, honestly no desire to live life. After 9 months on it I can say I am happy again.

I heard someone saying the other day “the worst thing you can do is depend on medication”. Mate I’ll tell you just once, the worst thing IN THE WORLD is to live depressed. Please give yourself permission to use this as a tool for the time that you need. Living life depressed is the worst possible thing and it steals amazing opportunities you could have in life.

I've been on it for 6 months. Since this is my first anti-depressant, I was started at 5mg and moved up to 10mg after two weeks. The first week was very tough. I woke up in the night with sweats and a racing heart. The first few days I felt a bit foggy/bit of a head high. I was forewarned that this was normal, so I persevered; I'm so glad I did! My day-to-day anxiety has been reduced tremendously. I can sleep through the night, I handle stress well, and I feel like I'm in control of my life. I'm excited to try new things and I'm more social. Before starting Lexapro, I had depression that felt like a fog - no energy, disinterested, plus frequent migraines. I haven't had any of those symptoms since going on the pill. When I'm in situations that trigger my PTSD I feel much more prepared to handle and get through the situation. This pill has saved my life.""",,,,,,,,,,

I was switched from lisinopril because it caused me to cough too much. Losartan has kept my BP down to pretty much normal levels. Possible side effects (first two of which I doubt are Losartan caused) are hair loss, frequent urination and diarrhea. First one could just be natural/hereditary. All the men in my family have or had thinned hair as they got old. Second one could be reduced kidney function due to being pre-diabetic which was undiagnosed for years. The last one, diarrhea is one I think is most likely to be an actual side effect. Though I would prefer to just call it soft/watery stools. I don't go any more often than I did before Losartan. I will bring it up at my next Doctor visit though. Overall a great medication for blood pressure.""",,,,,,,,,,

Over the years, I tried to self diagnose, thinking my attacks happened when I was living wrong. I always felt it was somehow my conscience trying to get me to live differently. I always felt guilty and paranoid about how I was living.
It is only in the last year or so, that it occurred to me that I actually might have a more severe case of OCD than I thought. It is not anything obvious, but I know that I spend hours a day with my lists of things. I don't have friends although I am very friendly. I can't ""waste my time."" I don't get out a lot. 
I usually notice my ""panic attacks"" occurred after having had some alcohol, although often not a lot.
I have become afraid of the night coming because then if I get an attack, I cannot talk to people, I cannot drive places, do stuff to distract my brain. The main thing is that I cannot sleep or even try to lay my head down because if I do not distract my brain, the terrifying feeling overcomes me. I will be exhausted but afraid to lie down.
 My attacks have started to last throughout the day because I sense that total unbearable fear of things I cannot control or are futile. For example, never speaking to my ex again, the unbearable thought of my mother passing away, even little stuff like where I lost a pair of glasses. Terrifying! 
I never thought my panic attack symptoms  were like the classic ones I’ve been reading about-no racing heart, just an absolute paranoia and NOW I HAVE concluded that my problem is related to my OCD.
 It is only in reading all of your comments that I begin to really understand that this is biochemical. Is this something that is best treated through a psychiatrist?

Things were getting very bad and I didn’t know how to fix or deal with it.  I was put on 10 mg lexapro by my new doctor.  I took half a pill a day for one week and didn’t notice any difference.  I actually had pretty severe headaches, problems with my sexual life and extreme exhaustion.  I began taking a full 10 mg pill a few days ago (I’m on day 10) and I have noticed I am back to my normal self.  The anxiety has completely gone away.   It seems it has saved my life.  The exhaustion and headaches went away.  It seems like this may be common in the first week or so.  The  negative to lexapro is some issues with sex (ejaculating specifically).  I have heard your body can adjust and eventually that will become normal as well.  I would definitely recommend people to give this medicine a few weeks to a month before giving up on it.

I was depressed, anxious and had tremendous amounts of social anxiety since my childhood.
I had no history of substance abuse, I was in foreign land, and at the age of 23 I was diagnosed with BPD.
I was in therapy too but it didn't help much, finally my psych doc prescribed with 150 mg zoloft with a starting dose of 50mg.
First 2 days were a nightmare and later on I stuck with doc's advise and gradually upped my dose till 150mg. I started to love myself a lot after 75mg, people around me started to notice a difference and I'm a lot happier. It has been now 6 years on zoloft. But I cut off my dosage to 75mg.

I myself reduced the dose to 25mg and immediately the anxiety went down again. I informed my doctor about this, and he reduced my prescribed dose back to 25mg. So far, it has been good; it has been a week since the change, and I'm definitely feeling way better than I did prior to starting sertraline. I still experience some anxiety but not at the scary levels that I was feeling previously, which made life seem not worth living. I feel optimistic and happy to be alive again.

Even when I'm laying down constipated and feels like a ball moving around in my chest and body legs and so forth.  It has been very, very scary as I have been like this for 3 weeks after taking the antibiotic. This all started happening and then the symptoms I mean go away then come back I hope this goes away soon.  I've been in ER 7 times and they said everything is fine with you which I mostly know but this feeling is uncomfortable and scary.

I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24!
